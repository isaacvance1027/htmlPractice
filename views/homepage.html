            <h2>About:</h2>
            
            <p>
                I am a 27 year old creative thinker, mathematician, 
                and artist currently studying Computer Science in order 
                to build a career in which I can integrate my diverse set 
                of skills to contribute to an enthusiastic team that shares 
                my passion for creation and overcoming challenges. 
                I earned my first Bachelor’s degree from the University 
                of Colorado at Boulder with a double major in Math and Economics, 
                and I am about to finish my second Bachelor’s degree in 
                Computer Science in December of this year. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I only have two classes remaining in my degree and am 
                comfortable with Object Oriented Programming, 
                Test Driven Development, Multi-Threaded Programming, 
                Functional Programming, and Algorithmic Design and Analysis. 
                I am proficient in several languages and have implemented 
                projects using C++, C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Scala. 
                My projects teams and I have extensively tracked our project 
                versions using Git as our primary VCS, and Github’s KanBan 
                board for our project management. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At my prior internship with Sporian Microsystems, 
                I worked remotely through their private VPN and servers in 
                order to implement a WebUI for a government contract project 
                regarding mechanical prognostic analysis. Due to the 
                classified nature of my work at Sporian, I am unable to 
                display my contributions on my Github profile, but in my 
                exit interview the CEO informed me that I am well 
                within my NDA to discuss the technologies that we used 
                for my work including: Python Flask Framework, Git VCS, 
                valgrind, SQLlite, JavaScript, and Redmine Issue 
                tracking and project management. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am excited for an opportunity to work with experienced 
                developers so I can grow my skill set and continue to 
                integrate more of my passions and knowledge into my career. 
                I hope to gain hands-on experience using cloud based development 
                tools and pipelines such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, 
                as well as experience with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins.
