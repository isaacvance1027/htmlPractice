    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>
        I am a 27 year old creative thinker, mathematician, 
        and artist currently studying Computer Science in order 
        to build a career in which I can integrate my diverse set 
        of skills to contribute to an enthusiastic team that shares 
        my passion for creation and overcoming challenges. 
        I earned my first Bachelor’s degree from the University 
        of Colorado at Boulder with a double major in Math and Economics, 
        and I am about to finish my second Bachelor’s degree in 
        Computer Science in December of this year. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I only have two classes remaining in my degree and am 
        comfortable with Object Oriented Programming, 
        Test Driven Development, Multi-Threaded Programming, 
        Functional Programming, and Algorithmic Design and Analysis. 
	    I am proficient in several languages and have implemented 
        projects using C++, C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Scala. 
        My projects teams and I have extensively tracked our project 
        versions using Git as our primary VCS, and Github’s KanBan 
        board for our project management. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At my prior internship with Sporian Microsystems, 
        I worked remotely through their private VPN and servers in 
        order to implement a WebUI for a government contract project 
        regarding mechanical prognostic analysis. Due to the 
        classified nature of my work at Sporian, I am unable to 
        display my contributions on my Github profile, but in my 
        exit interview the CEO informed me that I am well 
        within my NDA to discuss the technologies that we used 
        for my work including: Python Flask Framework, Git VCS, 
        valgrind, SQLlite, JavaScript, and Redmine Issue 
        tracking and project management. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I am excited for an opportunity to work with experienced 
        developers so I can grow my skill set and continue to 
        integrate more of my passions and knowledge into my career. 
        I hope to gain hands-on experience using cloud based development 
        tools and pipelines such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, 
        as well as experience with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins.
